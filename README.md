### Nicked Winner Reveal

If you join a lobby after the game where the winner was nicked, the mod will reveal their name and remember it for futher use.

#### TODO

* Add options
  * **ratingOnly** - if enabled, the mod will show rating only. Will be faster, because it omits a request to Hypixel API.
  * etc
* Display box on the screen with ratings:
